This code will take in a username, fetch that user's recent activity feed in JSON which is piped through a 
Yahoo! Pipe to get JSONP so we can do the remote pull. Then it's printed (sort of) like GitHub does it. The 
HTML markup/CSS is easy enough to change.

* Requires jQuery, jquery.timeago.js (included)

Add a div with the id 'githubActivity' to your HTML. Then put: 

githubActivity("username");

into your $(document).ready().

TODO:
* Finish adding HTML for all GitHub events.
* Comment code
* Maybe try to eliminate dependencies if I get bored enough.
